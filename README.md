Defining the Question
Our main objective is to analyze the provided data and come up with most relevant marketing strategies that will result to highest number of sales.

# Metrics of Success
Part 1, dimentionality reduction, reduce our data set to a low dimensional dataset using the t-SNE algorithm or PCA and provide insights gained from analysis.

Part 2, Feature Selection, perform the analysis and provide the insights that most contribute to the data set.

Part 3, Association Rule, create association rules that will allow us to identify relationships between variables in the data set.

Part 4, we are to check whether there are any anomalies in the given sales dataset and provide insights on fraud detection.
